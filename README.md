# Yearly follow-up during your PhD studies

## Study Right & Initial ISP
- Apply for study rights via **study.info**.
- After acceptance and at the start of the doctoral studies, the student has **3 months** to write or update the **Individual Study Plan (ISP)** based on the document used to apply for the study rights.

## Annual ISP Update & Follow-Up Committee
- The **ISP must be updated every year**.
- As part of the yearly follow-up, the student recruits a **Thesis Follow-Up Committee**.
  - **Aim:** Promote successful progress of the thesis by providing subject matter and implementation expertise. If needed, the **study plan and research plan may be updated based on the committee’s discussions**.
  - **Composition (recommended):** **2 members** (internal to **AAU** and/or external) + the supervisor(s).
  - **Recruitment:** By the **doctoral student** together with the **supervisor(s)**.

## Committee Meetings: Frequency, Roles & Confidentiality
- The **follow-up committee convenes every year until the thesis defence**.
- The **doctoral student** is responsible for **organizing** the meetings.
- If problems related to the thesis work or supervision arise, the student may **contact committee members between scheduled meetings**.
- The student must have the opportunity to **discuss issues in confidence** with the committee.
- The **doctoral programme monitors** implementation of the **supervision plan** and the **committee’s activity**.

## Process Overview

### Within the first 3 months of start
- Update the **ISP**.
- **Recruit** the thesis follow-up committee.
- The first thesis follow-up committee can already be organised.


### Before each committee meeting
- **Update the ISP** and **share it** with committee members.

### During each committee meeting (≤ **90 minutes**, suggested)
The doctoral student:
- Presents the **doctoral training plan** and a **summary of goals** for the next follow-up period.
- Focuses discussion on:
  - **What is required to graduate**
  - **Expected graduation date**
  - **Progress so far** (courses, project milestones)
  - **Publication plan**
  - **Funding plan**
- The TFC gives **feedback on the research plan** and helps **train presentation skills**.
- **Final 10 minutes:** supervisors are **dismissed**; the student continues **confidentially** with the committee to raise any supervision-related issues or concerns.

### After each meeting
- The student **reflects on the discussion**, writes **brief minutes** to share with all participants, and makes **final updates to the ISP** for submission to the graduate school.
